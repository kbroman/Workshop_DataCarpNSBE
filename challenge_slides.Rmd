# Challenge 1

The function `str()` tells you about the structure of a data object. Use `str()` with the `gapminder` data.

- How many countries are there?
- What is the "class" of this data object?

---

# Challenge 2

Which of the following are *not* equivalent?

a. `gapminder[50,4]` and `gapminder[50, "lifeExp"]`
b. `gapminder[50,4]` and `gapminder[4, 50]`
c. `gapminder[50,4]` and `gapminder$lifeExp[50]`

---

# Challenge 3

Which countries have had life expectancies greater than 80?

---

# Challenge 4

What was the population of the United States in 1952?

---

# Challenge 5

Using pipes, subset the gapminder data to grab rows where `gdpPercap` is greater than or equal to 35,000. Retain the columns `country`, `year`, and `gdpPercap`.

---

# Challenge 6

Use `mutate` to calculate the total GDP in billions of dollars, retrieve just the results for the year 2007, and sort the rows so that the total GDP is in decreasing order.

---

# Challenge 7

What was the average life expectancy (`lifeExp`) by continent in 2007?

---

# Challenge 8

Calculate the overall GDP per capita by continent in the years 1952 and 2007.

---

# Challenge 8

Calculate the overall GDP per capita by continent in the years 1952 and 2007.

1. Use `filter()` to pull out the rows with `year %in% c(1952,2007)`.
2. Use `mutate()` to calculate the total GDP for each country.
3. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` (with `sum()`) to calculate the total GDP and total population for each continent.
4. Use `mutate()` to calculate the GDP per capita for each continent.

# Challenge 9


Make a scatterplot of `lifeExp` vs `gdpPercap` with only the data for
China.

---

# Challenge 10


Try out the `size` and `shape` aesthetics in a scatterplot
of `lifeExp` vs `gdpPercap`.

- Make the points' `size` correspond to the population.
- Make the points' `shape` correspond to the continent.
- What happens if you use `aes(color=pop)`?
- How about `aes(shape=pop)`?

---

# Challenge 11


Make a plot of `lifeExp` vs `gdpPercap` for China and India, with
both lines and points.

---

# Challenge 12


Explore the distribution of the population sizes of countries, by
continent.

---

# Challenge 13


Select five countries of interest (e.g., China, India, US, France,
Nigeria) and plot `lifeExp` vs `gdpPercap` across time (with
`geom_line`), faceting by country.

---

# Challenge 14


Revisit a few of the plots you've made and try saving PNG and PDF
files. Try different heights and widths. Try out the `scale` parameter.

---

# Challenge 15


Create a plot with lines for the United States and Sweden, but
using the axis limits defined with the full data.

---

# Challenge 16


Make a set of histograms of `lifeExp` for the year 2007, using
`facet_grid` to split by continent. Use different colors
for the five continents, chosen manually.
